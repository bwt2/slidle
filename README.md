# Slidle ðŸ§©
A simple Wordle clone inspired by the standard sliding puzzle minigame written in **React.js** using **Vite** deployed on **Vercel**.
- Arrow keys to shift the tiles around.
- If a clear stright line from the side directional arrow and the edge of the board can be drawn, you win. 

## TODO
1. Add a new button to do a different puzzle.
2. Create better board shuffling algorithm to ensure 100% solvability.
3. Mobile touchscreen support.

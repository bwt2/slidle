# Slidle ðŸ§©
A Wordle clone inspired by the standard sliding puzzle minigame written in React.js using Vite.
- Arrow keys to shift the tiles around.
- If a clear stright line from the side directional arrow and the edge of the board can be drawn, you win. 

## TODO
1. Add a new button to do a different puzzle.
2. Create better board shuffling algorithm to ensure 100% solvability.
